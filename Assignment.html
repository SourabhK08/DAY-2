            <br>
            <p>C++ is an Object Oriented Programming Language.
                <br> The main pillars of Object Oriented
                Programming are :

                    Object :An Object is an identifiable
                    entity with some characteristics and behavior.
                    An Object is an instance of a Class.
                     When a
                    class is defined, no memory is allocated but
                    when it is instantiated (i.e. an
                    object is created) memory is allocated.
                    <br><br>
                <p>Class :It is the instances or identifiable entity with some common characterstics & behaviour.
                 Each object contains data encode to manipulate the data and Object has the properties and behaviour defined by it's class.

            <br>
            <p>Considering the important details by hiding the background details. </p>
                <p> Consider a real life example of a man driving
                a car. The man only knows that pressing the
                accelerators will increase the speed of car
                or applying brakes will stop the car but he
                does not know about how on pressing accelerator
                the speed is actually increasing, he does
                not know about the inner mechanism of the car
                or the implementation of accelerator, brakes
                etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Encapsulation">

            <br>
            <p>
                Encapsulation is defined as
            binding together the data and the functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider
            a real life example
            of encapsulation, in a company there are
            different sections like the accounts section,
            finance section, sales section etc. The finance
            section handles all the financial transactions
            and keep records of all the data related to
            finance.
            Similarly the sales section handles all the
            sales related activities and keep records of
            all the sales. Now there may arise a situation
            when for some reason an official from finance
            section needs all the data about sales in a
            particular
            month. In this case, he is not allowed to
            directly access the data of sales section.
            He will first have to contact some other
            officer in the sales section and then
            request him to
            give the particular data. This is what
            encapsulation is. Here the data of
            sales section and the
            employees that can manipulate them are
            wrapped under a single name “sales section”.

            <p>
                Inheritance means Getting something from something that already exsists.
            </p>
            <br>
                    <p>It is the capability of one class to acquire the properties of another class . Original class is known as Base class / Super class / Parent class and derived class is known as Sub class / Child class.</p>

            <p>
                Polymorphism can be defined as a technique that allows defining various forms of a single function or operator that can be shared by various object to perform the operation .
            </p><br>
            <p>There are 2 types of polymorphism :
